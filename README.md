IDDS is a free and open source intrusion detection and prevention system for Windows Server 2008 R2 and later. 

# Note

Its a fork of https://idds.codeplex.com/  and since Codeplex is dying then this repository acts as a backup if you want to fork into github.

It's not supported.  I repeat, it is only a backup. :-P
